Welcome to **Kitchen-Buddy**, an Expo project designed to help you manage your kitchen inventory with ease. This app allows you to keep track of ingredients, filter them by various properties, and even scan barcodes to automatically populate ingredient details using OpenFoodFacts APIs.

## Features

### 1. Add Ingredients
Easily add new ingredients to your kitchen inventory. You can manually input all the details required to keep track of what you have.

### 2. Show List of Ingredients
View a comprehensive list of all the ingredients in your inventory. The list displays all relevant details to help you stay organized.

### 3. Filter Ingredients List
Filter the list of ingredients by category and other properties. This feature makes it easy to find exactly what you're looking for, whether it's a specific type of ingredient or items with a particular attribute.

### 4. Show List of Ingredients Expiring Soon
Never let ingredients go to waste! This feature provides a list of items that are nearing their expiration date, so you can use them before they spoil.

### 5. Barcode Scanning and Auto-Fill
Save time by scanning the barcode of any ingredient. Kitchen-Buddy integrates with OpenFoodFacts APIs to fetch product information and automatically fill in all the fields, making the process quick and accurate.
